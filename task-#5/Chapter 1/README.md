1. Operators { * , - , / , + } and values are { 'hello' , -88.8 , 5 }
2. spam is a variable while 'spam' is a string.
3. int, float and string are three data types.
4. An expression is made up of operators such as * , + , - , / so on and values such as 1.00 , 2 , -4 so on( that can be integer type or float type).
   Expressions compute and always ends up being a unique value.
5. Assignment statements assigns a particular value to something. While an expression computes a value based on the operators and values which are given to it and provide a unique value at the end.
6. no change 

7. a)spamspamspam b) spamspamspam
8. Only numbers as a variable name is invalid while a number starting with an underscore can be used a valid variable name.
9. int() ,  float()  , str()
10. That expression gives error because it has 99 (int) which cannot be used in string concatenation. Inorder to use string concatenation all the elemnts should be of string type. So here we can convert 99 of int type to str(99) which is now a string.
   ' I have eaten ' + str(99) + 'burritos.'
