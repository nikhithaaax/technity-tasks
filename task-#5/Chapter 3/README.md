1. Functions allow us to break down a complex program into smaller modules. Each function performs a specific task or solve a particular problem. This grouping makes code easier to understand, maintain, and debug. Also functions can be used in different parts of your program saving the time and effort.
2. The code is executed when the function is called.
3. def functionname(args) creates a function.
4. function defines a function whereas when the defined function is called upon to execute it is function call.
5. There can be only one global scope in python programming which encompasses entire program. There can be any number of local scopes in the program which is created as soon as function is called.
6. The variables in local scope will be destroyed when the function call returns.
7. A return value is something that consists of a value or expression function should return. Yes return value can be expression.
8. The function will return None without returing any return value.
9. If there's no such variable available in the local scope then that variable will refer to the global scope's variable.
10. Datatype of None is Nonetype.
11. Imports that particular module if it exists and is installed by the user or a module by the given name is created separately by the user.
12. import spam

    spam.bacon()
13. Exception Handling concept can be used to prevent a program from crashing when an error occurs. ( Try and except statements)
14. The code that may contain error can be kept in try block whereas that exception can be handled with a message in except block .
