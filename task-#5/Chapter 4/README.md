1. It refers to an empty list
2. Using insert function spam.insert(2,"hello").
3. spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] gives spam[3] which gives 'd'.
4. spam[-1] evaluates to 'd'.
5. spam[:2] evaluates to o and 1 that is ['a','b'].
6. bacon.index('cat') evaluates to 1.
7. bacon.append(99) adds up the value 99 at the end of the list which looks like [3.14 , 'cat' , 11, 'cat' , True , 99].
8. bacon.remove('cat') removes 'cat' from the list. The new list will look like [3.14, 'cat', 11, True, 99].
9. '+' operator is used for concatenation while '*' operator is used for replication.
10. append() adds the value at the end of the list whereas insert() inserts an element at a particular index(mentioned)in the list.
11. list.remove() and list.pop().
12. Both lists and strings can iterate using loops like for loops.Also lists and strings support indexing and slicing. The len() function can be used to determine the length (number of elements or characters) of both lists and strings.
13. List's values are changeable whereas tuple values are fixed (unchangeable).
14. spam=(42)
15. To get the tuple form of a list value tuple(list) is used and to get the list form of a tuple value list(tuple) is used.
16. Variables containing lists don't have actual value , they store references (also known as pointers or memory addresses) to the memory location where the list data is stored.
17. copy.copy() is used to copy a changeable lists while copy.deepcopy() is used for the lists containing another lists which needs to copied.
